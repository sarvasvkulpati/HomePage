[x] normal door
True fans of Minecraft will notice this door inspired by the spruce door in Minecraft! 

Minecraft is probably my favourite video game ever. I spend hundreds of hours making stuff on it in middle school. It's also where I first learnt about logic gates.

It really is the digital lego of this generation. You can start with a bunch of simple concepts, and people can build immense complexity out of it. Houses and functioning computers and statues and art, you name it. 

Add multiplayer to that, and it's even more beautiful. I have so many memories of making world on Minecraft with my friends, and they stay with me the way the memory of a childhood home stays with someone.

Minecraft, and Club Penguin before it, is an inspiration for this HomePage project. This is a place, with stuff in it, with *ambient context*, as opposed to a bullet pointed list.



[x] movies
I. LOVE. MOVIES. 

There's something about movies that feels almost primitive. Especially in the 21st century, there aren't many mediums that bring us all together like that any more. It's the modern equivalent of a tribe sitting around the fireplace and hearing the shaman tell stories.

More than that, it's an amalgamation of mediums. It's writing and photography and movement and music all coming together to make something that's greater than the sum of their parts. What's not to love.

I have a pretty wide taste in movies. 
- I love myself some classics and epics like Lawrence of Arabia and the LOTR trilogy
- I'm unashamedly a huge fan of the Infinity Saga (I religiously watched every movie and followed every fan theory online)
- Tarantino movies make me feel pumped every time I watch them
- One of the strangest movies I've watched that I really loved was Adaptation. Charlie Kaufman is a genius.




[x] origami
Ah origami, one of my first true creative loves. I had a few origami and paper plane folding books when I was 6. And I was obsessed. I remember going to a friends house and folding every single paper plane described in a book I had. 

By the time I was in 4th grade, my desk in school used to be overflowing with folded paper. I'd obsessively watch youtube tutorials on different origami designs, an interest that eventually led me to find channels talking about electronics, which eventually got me interested in computer science!

Probably the funniest anecdote I have about paper planes is that in 6th grade, my school decided to put my obsession to good use and signed me up for [a paper plane competition at Singapore's Science Center](https://safmc.com.sg/). *I ended up breaking the record at the time for longest distance paper airplane flight.*


[x] electronics
Electronics were my gateway drug into computing. The channels that did origami/craft tutorials also sometimes did stuff with electronics (click on the origami to learn more).

Seeing an Arduino power some blinky lights, or a cute little servo robot, and realising that *I* could do that? That was a revelation.

I got my dad to get me this super basic electronics kit and shitty soldering iron and oh boy the things I made. 

I wish I'd documented these more but over the years I built:
- a DIY super bright LED light for Youtube because I didn't want to pay for a real one
- I taught myself trig a year early to understand simple inverse kinematics to make a walking 4 legged robot with servos
- Several LED displays 
- I made an electric skateboard (that I never used because I didn't figure out breaks and I didn't want to die a tragic death)

[x] guitars
I'm a Piano player, but something about guitars is just so cool to me. I guess string instruments are naturally more versatile- you can do bends and vibratos and all sorts of things you can't do with a piano. And let's admit it, there's something just *cool* about guitars.

I also love how *beautiful* guitars can be. Or that you can make your own guitar from scratch. Or that you can make your own guitar amps (I remember watching Make: tutorials on making guitar amps and having no idea what that meant). Something just feels personal about them in a way other instrument aren't.

I picked up a guitar for the first time during the pandemic, and I've been stealing my friends' guitars over the last 2 years and teaching myself basic chords. I still mess up barre chords at times, but I'm getting somewhere. Unlike the piano, guitars are purely for fucking around and having fun.



[x] plants
Okay I think I only realised this recently, but I've always loved plants. In 5th grade, I was part of a few students who helped start our school's garden. One set of my grandparents have a wonderful garden where as a kid, I'd help the farmer with tasks around the place.

I always find it strange how little nature has to do with a lot of technologists vision for the future. It's always about pushing boundaries, about reaching for the stars (which I am totally for, let's get to Mars etc.) but what about where we are right now? 

I guess I've only realised how important feeling connected to nature is in college. It might sound overly earnest or kumbaya-y (I know I used to think that) but we truly need to feel connected to our environment.

Technologists say they're for life, for human growth and expansion, but how much life to they cultivate in their daily lives? So many people saying this stuff don't have kids, or maybe even pets, or maybe even a plant. If we care about life, we should start by cultivating our own garden.


[x] piano
I started learning the Piano when I was 7, and I was always shit at it. By that, I mean that I never really practiced other than when I had a lesson with a teacher (or when I was overly stressed for a piano exam). 

I have a 5th grade ABRSM in practical and 6th in theory, but by 10th grade, I'd had enough. I didn't want to learn obscure pieces just to go up the ranks in a grading system I didn't care about. So I stopped learning for the grades and started learning what I found interesting.

And in a year, I'd learnt more interesting and challenging pieces than ever before. Pathetique, Liebestraum, Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C, Claire de Lune. (I haven't really practiced in college, but I'll get back up there). It's a perfect example about how the right motivators unlocks learning.

But a recent development- the first time I walked into a piano class, I remember asking when I'd get to make my own music, and they said that 'that comes much later'. I think that was so stupid. For years, I haven't been able to put on paper what I hear in my head, but hopefully that'll change soon. I've started playing original stuff for just myself, but at some point, maybe I'll put it online for people to see. 




[x] camera

Youtube youtube youtube. In 6th grade, I was obsessed with Ryan Higa, and youtube in general. I'd watch tutorials on origami and electronics and DIY stuff and skits and minecraft gaming videos. And so in 7th grade I decided that I'd start a Youtube channel myself. 

Over the next 1.5 years, I published 2-3 videos almost every week. In retrospect, the videos are so cringey (I've turned them all private to protect me from the sheer embarrassment) but there was something kind of beautiful about making them. 

I'd get to pull a friend into something almost every week. My friends, their siblings, sometimes even their parents would ask me about when my next video would be out. Making something that often was such a thrill. 

And then, I stopped. I'm not even sure why, I guess I'd moved to a new school and had just turned a teenager and it a) didn't feel so cool anymore and b) I had just gotten braces, and felt strange, and, yeah it just petered out. 

Over highschool, I attempted to 'restart' several times, but all I have to show for that is a graveyard of incomplete half-edited videos. Finally, when covid hit, I decided to go for it again, and I've had my Youtube up ever since!

Sometimes, I wonder what I'm still on there for, and I'm so much more self-conscious that I was when I first did it. But something's made me stay. Maybe it's the opportunity to self express. I don't know, but I'm rolling with it.



[x] switch

So I haven't actually ever owned a Switch, but this, to me, is representative of a huge interest of mine- hardware and single purpose devices.

I can say I love my e-scooter, I love my camera, people love their switches, but do I love my iPhone? Not really. It's more of a love-hate relationship. I couldn't live without it, but it also constantly distracts me, and it's like an uphill battle to make sure I'm not checking out from what I'm supposed to be doing when I'm stressed.

The Switch is an example of what good device design can be. On an iPhone, the default position is hunched over. Closed off body language, kinda sad looking aura. With the switch, it's *designed* to be social. When I see people using a switch, it's almost always that they're excited, looking up at the screen, body language open. 

How can we design devices that keep our vibe open and playful and happy as opposed to stressed and closed off and clenchy? That's the big question.



[x] mac

The computer I used to play Minecraft (see the door on the left), make my first videos on, watch movies on, and more. 

In a way, Apple really is responsible for so many of those creative pursuits. Sometimes I wonder if they're "just" a technology company, but I think the story Steve Jobs wove around them, a story about individualism and creativity and thinking different, it really did reflect into the products they made. 

Steve once described Apple- "it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing." Technology was easy to get, but how the liberal arts and humanities and making the heart sing connects has slowly been dawning on me.


[x] books

I used to tear through books as a kid. I used to read encylopedias lying around the house for fun from when I was 6. I finished reading all Harry Potter books in 3rd grade, all the LOTR books in 6th grade, and read all 5 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books in 5 days on a no-internet spell when I was visiting my grandparents in India. 

Recently, I've been broadly interested in:
- Psychoanalysis: I loved The Courage to Be Disliked, so I read some primary texts from Adler. I'm never not fascinated by anything Jung wrote, and in general I like parsing through any books that talk about the subconscious and why we do what we do
- Cybernetics/computing/intelligence: the Cybernetic Brain, a new kind of science, cybernetics, are we smart enough to know how smart animals are
- Fiction: Idek how to describe it so I'll list some- confessions of a mask, the unbearable lightness of being (a favourite), Ted Chiang's short stories, Atlas Shrugged

Trying to read more biographies and fiction.


[x] pegboard

I have a certain obsession with organised chaos. Like knolling, or a well organised grocery cart, Casey Neistat's studio, or the organisation of a circuit board. Pegboard are the most accessible version of that I know. 

Another interest they intersect with is Hardware. I think it's a fundamentally human thing to make things with our hands, and we're so cushioned by our abstractions that most people don't do anything that requires fine motor skills any more. We rely so heavily on our devices that we're disconnected from our own bodies.

And so, I like making things in the real world! I like working with wood or drawing or folding things (see the origami on the left). 



[] whiteboard

I've been interested in teaching and education since forever (though likely heavily influenced by watching [3 idiots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots) at a pivotal age).

- I started out by [teaching what became my school's largest coding club](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/why-im-teaching-younger-students-at-my-school-how-to-code-f74ba3f174e3).
- I made a app that paired students with on-demand tutors for my school's 10th grade board exams.
- I volunteered at a preschool in 9th grade, and then at a school for immigrants and refugees in my sophomore year of Berkeley.
- I made[ an online community where we taught each other everything from math to react](https://twitter.com/SarvasvKulpati/status/1247181074611851267?s=20) during covid.
- Singapore had a strict lockdown, and I found it ridiculous that kids as young as 6 were spending their entire day in front of a computer, so I took a gap semester to run online, and then in person small individual or group classes where I taught kids ages 6-15 interactively.
- I made a search engine at the end of my freshman year that indexed Berkeley's Computer Science curriculum, and had 300+ people use it to help study for their finals. 



HomePage: a tiny experiment in what websites can be


For some reason, we've collectively decided that a website is a digital version of a printed sheet of paper. Personal websites are almost all just variations on the same thing- a bullet pointed list. 

This makes sense for practicality, but why have we all just *accepted* this? I don't think a plain bullet pointed list of where someone works and what school they go to can sum up anyone. What do they _like_? What's their _vibe_? What if your homepage on the internet _actually felt like a home_?

You know what did show my personality and who I was? My club penguin igloo. Or my minecraft hut. It was a place. It told stories about who I was. 

And so this is a basic experiment in making my homepage feel like a Home I invite you to, vs. a sheet of paper I hand to you. The internet can be more mystical, expansive, and homely than we think. The internet isn't a distribution mechanism for an outdated metaphor, it's a place, and we should start acting as such. It's ridiculous that we're talking about Web 3 and all this newfangled stuff when the basic potential of the internet hasn't been touched yet

Anyway, spiel over. Hover over objects and click them to read tiny stories or blurbs about how they relate to me!
